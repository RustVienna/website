We will have our second meetup in the metalab.at hackerspace in Vienna.

our talks so far are:

Writing Websocket Servers by Andreas Monitzer.

"I've created a websocket server with two different crates, ws (with a mio backend) and websocket (asynchronously, with a tokio backend). The former lacks a lot of features, while the latter is really badly documented. I can shine a light on both of them, showing how to use them and what their capabilities are."

Others TBA.
