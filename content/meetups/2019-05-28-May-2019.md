I will talk about Threads simple mechanics like Mutex, Readwrite lock how they behave, spawning of threads, sharing between stack and heap in threads, how atomics work, atomic ordering in assembly instructions, send and sync markers.

Also depending on the size we can look at a communication PoC of an simulation which I wrote. 3 different actors (real processes not only actix | 1 is actix 2 or seperate 'dumb' future based clients) who communicate, basically me hacking the compiler to simulate "realtime http communication". "how can I define a hashmap a global static but still modify it"? ;D ... "so i cannot partial copy a struct .... how about I write my own http server implementation so I don't need sync and send?", "where do i have to remove the .wait() so it does resolve?" and so on ... getting sh!t done ... #yolo
