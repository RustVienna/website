Dear cRustecians,

we are happy to announce our speaker(s) for this months Meetup.

Our first talk will be:

Embedded Rust, by example of RIOT-OS applications

Rust can be used on embedded systems (microprocessors in the several-kB range like ARM Cortex M3) in various ways. This talk gives a brief overview of possibilities, and shows examples of running atop the RIOT operating system via the C FFI.

Christian Ams√ºss is active in Free Software communities since 2005, and develops with embedded devices and their networks since 2011. He started using embedded Rust looking for ways to bring secure connectivity to the Web of Things in a more (re)usable way.

others TBA.

We're looking forward to see you all.

Your vienna-rust team.
